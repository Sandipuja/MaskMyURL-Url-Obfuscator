## Features

- **URL Obfuscation**: Mask URLs to protect sensitive information.
- **Open Redirects**: Use open redirect vulnerabilities to hide the final destination.
- **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Implement basic authentication for added security.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies make it easy to deploy.
- **Cybersecurity Focused**: Ideal for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

## Installation

To get started with MaskMyURL, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sandipuja/MaskMyURL-Url-Obfuscator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MaskMyURL-Url-Obfuscator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Script**:
   You can download the latest version of the script from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Sandipuja/MaskMyURL-Url-Obfuscator/releases). Make sure to execute the script after downloading.

## Usage

To use MaskMyURL, run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python maskmyurl.py <target_url>
```

### Example

```bash
python maskmyurl.py https://example.com
```

This command will generate an obfuscated URL based on the provided target URL.

## How It Works

MaskMyURL leverages common techniques used in cybersecurity to obfuscate URLs:

1. **Open Redirects**: By exploiting open redirect vulnerabilities, the tool can redirect users to a different URL without revealing the actual endpoint.

2. **HTTP Basic Authentication**: This method adds a layer of security by requiring a username and password, making it harder for unauthorized users to access the final destination.

3. **Obfuscation Techniques**: The script applies various techniques to ensure that the original URL remains hidden, making it useful for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

### Example Workflow

1. **Identify Target**: Determine the URL you want to obfuscate.
2. **Run the Script**: Use the command line to run the script with the target URL.
3. **Obtain Obfuscated URL**: The script will return an obfuscated URL.
4. **Test the URL**: Use the obfuscated URL in a controlled environment to ensure it works as intended.
